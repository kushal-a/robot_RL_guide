# News and Updates

1. Isaac Sim had been close sourced for a long time. In June 2025, NVIDIA made Isaac Sim 5.0 open source.
2. Pybullet has not been well maintained in since 2023 (to 2025). It has since got one update in 2025. Although Pybullet does not have other dependencies, examples problems, tutorials and documentation still refers old and deprecated libraries. Pybullet RL examples still use the old Gym library. Hence, using pybullet for RL is problematic as of now (2025)
3. Although Isaac Sim 5.0 is open-source, it is still very new with several bugs. Isaac Lab 2.2 is compatible with Isaac Sim 4.5 and is the recommended compatibility.
4. There are updates coming in all these libraries very actively.
